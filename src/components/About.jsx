        Hello, I’m Shayan, a passionate Software Engineer and Computer Science student at The Ohio 
        State University, set to graduate in May 2027. I specialize in scale-oriented engineering, 
        with experience shipping production features and backend refactors for a consumer app with 
        over 490K daily active users. Through internships at WillowTree and Lighthouse Avionics, I 
        have contributed to large-scale, real-world applications ranging from intuitive iOS and web 
        apps to reliable backend infrastructure. A little fun fact about me is I love to travel. I've 
        been to 12 countries all around the world so far, and am excited for  what the future holds. 
        I also enjoy playing basketball, spending time with friends and family, and playing the piano 
        for its unique blend of creativity and patterns.
